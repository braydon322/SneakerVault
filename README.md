# SneakerVault
Flatiron School - Sinatra Final Portfolio Project

Sneaker Vault is a web application, designed by sneakerheads, for sneakerheads. We want you to have one place to go for your sneaker fix. We'd love to see this developed into a social platform, but now is not the time for that. Go ahead and add sneakers to your collection.

1. Build an MVC Sinatra Application. 
   
2. Use ActiveRecord with Sinatra.
      1. User has_many Shoes
      2. Shoe belongs_to User
      
3. Use Multiple Models.
     Models:
      1. User
      2. Shoes
      3. Scraper
        
4. Use at least one has_many relationship
      1. User has_many Shoes
      2. Shoe belongs_to User
      
5. Must have user accounts. The user that created a given piece of content should be the only person who can modify that content
    
6. You should validate user input to ensure that bad data isn't created
